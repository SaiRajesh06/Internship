To observe the speed of the DC motor using microcontroller.
The procedures below must be followed in order to use an 8051 microcontroller to regulate the speed of a DC motor:
Create and build a motor driver circuit to regulate the direction and speed of the motor.
Connect the 8051 microcontroller's necessary pins to the motor driver circuit.
The motor speed should be controlled by a PWM signal.
Set up a timer or counter on the 8051 microcontroller to produce a PWM signal.
Determine the timer settings needed to achieve the specified PWM duty cycle and frequency.
Set the chosen timer or counter to PWM mode after initialising it with the calculated settings.
The microcontroller firmware should have a speed control algorithm to modify the PWM duty cycle based on the intended motor speed.
